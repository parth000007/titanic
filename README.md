# Titanic Survivors Prediction Project

## Task Objectives
- Build a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- Use relevant data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.
- Provide clear and reproducible steps to run the project and evaluate the model.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib) using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
   - `titanic_model.ipynb`
   - `titanic_survival_model.ipynb`
5. Review the results and visualizations in the notebooks.
6. Optionally, use the provided dataset `tested 2.csv` for testing or further analysis.

## Project Structure
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and model building.
- `titanic_survival_model.ipynb`: Advanced modeling and evaluation.
- `tested 2.csv`: Dataset used for testing.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Clean, well-structured code.
- Clear documentation and instructions.
- Accurate and interpretable predictive model.
